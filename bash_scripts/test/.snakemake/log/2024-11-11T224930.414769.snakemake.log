Error in rule run_silent:
    jobid: 3
    output: 3gbn_silent.silent
    shell:
        silentfrompdbs binders/*.pdb > 3gbn_silent.silent
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_silent since they might be corrupted:
3gbn_silent.silent
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
